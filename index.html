        The role of the Committee is to review, evaluate and report to the Board of Education the Districtâ€™s facilities needs, including capital projects, deferred maintenance, and safety and security improvements, as well as financing options and alternatives.  The reason such an organization exists is that our city is in dire need of community members to provide input on certain facilities that needs renovation. This helps my community by allowing individuals to provide the best proposal for my city.
        I held the position of student representative. My role is to actively collect and provide input from all of the students throughout my school district. I  am also responsible for making recommendations to the school board about what needs to be changed throughout our district facilities. I learned many political technicalities and processes through architects and lawyers. My committee achieved a vote for $200 million bond by the San Marino School Board. 
        As Track and Field captain, I was expected to lead, guide, teach and manage the entire team. Prior to high school, I participated in track throughout my middle school which gave me experience when teaching other athletes throughout my high school years. As a captain of the team, the most important role is to guide and lead others.  Such a position is very crucial because you are acting as a mentor and an influence to your pupils. A captain also needs to be able to take charge in dire situations

        Scattered across my desk were the tiny computer components of my potential Mona Lisa. Building a computer seemed manageable, but only days into my project, I realized that my Mona Lisa had become my Frankenstein. The fear of making a wrong move consumed me as I risked the hundreds of dollars I had saved from years of allowance. After the excruciating effort, my computer was complete. Anticipatingly, I pressed the ON button. In the unchanging black screen, I could see my face fall.
        Despite my frustrating defeat, I began to brainstorm my next course of action. Thinking back to my 7th-grade math class, I realized that there are multifarious approaches when attempting to reach a solution. As algebra filled my head, the computer transformed into a simple equation. Considering the scores of variables, I stressfully returned to my work. When individually solving each variable, my path to success became clear.
        The motherboard's functionality was my first priority. When I discovered that the motherboard wasn't the problem, I tested its reaction with the CPU. I had found my stride. After double-checking each component, I once again hopefully anticipated the screens shift from black to white. A wave of relief washed over my body when the computer began to function. As a result, my mindset transformed from its usual one-track, all or nothing, state to a creativity-based pool of problem-solving positivity.
        Looking back, I realize that this problem-solving method has become a common tool that I apply to my current life and learning experiences. As a junior, I became interested in applying for the San Marino school foundation internship. The application process seemed overwhelming but I trusted my instincts and I broke down the processes, just as I had done when building my first computer. When the committee agreed that I was the best candidate, I successfully became an intern for my school's foundation. To me, creativity means inventing easier solutions to otherwise difficult obstacles and I, therefore, hope to explore the extent of my creative mind.
